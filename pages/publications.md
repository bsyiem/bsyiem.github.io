    title: "A Systematic Exploration of Collaborative Immersive Systems for Sense-making in STEM"
    excerpt: "Scientific sense-making in STEM fields is a complex, yet essential activity, that greatly benefits from collaborations. However, challenges associated with collaboration, such as the geographic separation of experts, access to specialised equipment, and meaningful data representation, often hinder this process. Solutions to collaborative challenges have been extensively explored in CSCW and HCI literature. Among such solutions, immersive systems offer novel data visualisations, interactions, and representations that can support collaborative sense-making in STEM fields. Recognising the increasing interest from HCI researchers on the intersection of collaboration and immersive systems, we conduct a systematic review to answer pertinent questions regarding the research landscape, the design and implementation of collaborative immersive systems for STEM sense-making. We find that current research leans towards synchronous collaborations, AR technology, and sense-making for learning in science domains. We further discuss prevalent trends and considerations observed in our findings, to inform future research directions."
