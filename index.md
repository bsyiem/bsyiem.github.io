# About Me

I am an HCI researcher who is fascinated by how novel technologies affect and shape our behaviours, experiences, and work practices. My research investigates new implementations, design and use of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies to enhance individual, social & collaborative experiences. ***I aim to shape the design of technology through better understanding of user physiology and psychology.***
