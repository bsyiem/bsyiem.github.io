# About Me

I am an HCI researcher who is fascinated by how novel technologies affect and shape our behaviours, experiences, and work practices. My research investigates new implementations, design and use of eXtended Reality (XR) technologies to enhance individual, social & collaborative experiences. ***My vision is to enhance user capabilities through technology designs that leverage human physiology, psychology, and behaviours.***
